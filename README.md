# ShEx Extends Paper Companion

This repository contains examples and code from the paper Shape Expressions with Inheritance, Iovka Boneva, Jose Emilio Labra Gayo, Eric Prud'hommeaux, Kat Thornton, Andra Waagmeester, Extended Semantic Web Conference, 2025

## Implementations

Practical implementations of ShEx with inheritance have been developed in:

- [ShEx.js](https://github.com/shexjs/shex.js), Javascript
- [ShEx-s](https://www.weso.es/shex-s/), Scala
- Fork of Apache Jena, Java

## Running the examples interactively

The examples from the paper can be run using two online ShEx validators:

- [ShEx-Simple](https://shex.io/webapps/shex.js/packages/shex-webapp/doc/shex-simple?manifestURL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weso/shex_extends_paper_companion/master/motivating_example/manifest.yml)
- [RDFShape](https://rdfshape.weso.es/link/17424943869)
